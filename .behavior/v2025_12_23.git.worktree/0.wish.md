wish =

take a hook at how the git worktree commands work here: https://github.com/ehmpathy/rhachet-roles-ehmpathy/blob/main/src/roles/mechanic/.skills/git.worktree.sh

we want to replicate those into bash_aliases

with the modification that each git worktree directory should also prefix the name of the repo as part of the name of the new directory

e.g.,

in rhachet repo, if we run
```sh
git worktree set vlad/new-feature
```

then we'd create a new dir with name `rhachet.vlad.new-feature`


---

then, we want to bind the git aliases of

`git tree set` and `git tree get` and `git tree del`

to these bash aliases
