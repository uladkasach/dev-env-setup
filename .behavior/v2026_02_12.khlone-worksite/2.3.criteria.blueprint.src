declare the blueprint criteria (mechanism bounds) that satisfies the blackbox criteria

ref:
- blackbox criteria .behavior/v2026_02_12.khlone-worksite/2.1.criteria.blackbox.md
- wish .behavior/v2026_02_12.khlone-worksite/0.wish.md
- vision .behavior/v2026_02_12.khlone-worksite/1.vision.md (if declared)

emit into .behavior/v2026_02_12.khlone-worksite/2.3.criteria.blueprint.md

blueprint criteria = MECHANISM BOUNDS
- constraints on what contracts & composition must exist to deliver the experience
- this is OPTIONAL — not all behaviors need prescribed mechanism bounds

first, confirm which blackbox experience bounds will be satisfied

then, declare ONLY:
- what subcomponents are demanded by the wish, vision, or criteria.blackbox? and with what contracts and boundaries?
- how do subcomponents compose together?
- what integration boundaries exist?
- what test coverage is required?

DO NOT prescribe:
- internal implementation details of subcomponents
- how subcomponents achieve their contracts internally
- any subcomponents not explicitly demanded in the wish, vision, or criteria.blackbox

note: blueprint criteria is NOT "how to build" — that's decided in blueprint.md (3.3)
      blueprint criteria is "what mechanisms must exist" to deliver the experience

the HOW is discovered during research (3.1) and decided during blueprint (3.3)
