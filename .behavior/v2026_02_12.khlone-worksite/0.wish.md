now, lets zoomin and start from scratch;                                                                            
                                                                                                                              
  lets envision the domain distillation and distinct operations                                                               
                                                                                                                              
  and the rest from here;                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                              
  rebuild the vision from a clear and comprehensive perspective



---

we want to be super crisp with the contract


ensure its super intuitive

and ensure it handles all of the key usecases enumerated in the v5 vision

but in a clearer and more cohesive and intuitive way


---


khlone act|ask $message [--talk|--watch|--await] [--zone $zone] [--who $cloneRef] [--when enqueue|disrupt] ...


---

 maybe it should be                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                              
  khlone list worksite|zone|crew -> lists worksites|zones|crews                                                               
  khlone status worksite|zone|crew -> gets status of worksite|zone|crew                                                       
                                                                                                                              
  ?                                                                                                                           
      


      ----


 yep, and definetly status will default to the most appropriate scope for the context. (pwd = branch? zone; pwd = main?      
  worksite; pwd = not even a gitrepo? orchestrator scope, which looks at the central ~/.khlone/orchestration/ state and       
  gives status of all worksites you've touched or are available to you);


  ---



yep, also, another scope = task; peer to crew, child of zone


---


yep, each ask and act is a task

---

and maybe its more like khlone status --task task-abc-123

---

that makes it simpler to work across scopes; e.g., you could be in worksite ahbode/app-hometools-native and want to check   
  on a status in worksite ahbode/svc-jobs (or act on it)                                                                      
                                                                                                                              
  makes all the flags super generic across all the verbs                                                                      
                                                                                                                              
  e.g.,                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                              
  khlone ask 'how to use xyz' --worksite svc-ads-online-search --role researcher++ >> howto.xyz.md (enrolls new zone + role
  to do ask)                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                              
  vs                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                              
  khlone status --zone feat/do-xyz --role architect


---





and lets specifically document that usecase with a few different examples to playtest it                     
  and formalize it                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                              
    khlone <verb> [args] [--worksite X] [--zone X] [--who X] [--task X]                                                       
    you can be anywhere and reach into any scope:                                                                             
    # sitting in app-hometools-native, check on svc-jobs                                                                      
    khlone status --worksite svc-jobs                                                                                         
    # enroll a researcher in a different repo to answer a question                                                             
    khlone ask 'how does auth work here' --worksite svc-auth --who researcher++ --await                                       
    # act on a specific zone in a different worksite                                                                     
    khlone act 'add tests' --worksite svc-jobs --zone @feat/billing --who mechanic.1                                        
    the orchestrator scope at ~/.khlone/ makes this possible — it knows about all worksites you've touched, so              
  cross-worksite                                   
    addressing just works.


----

and lets also be extra clear that by default all tasks are queued against the hero clone; i.e., the default clone that is
  enrolled ; (e.g., the foreman role); with the expectation that in their setup either the hero is a delegator (like foreman)
  or they specifically want to handle all delegation themselves (via --who)


---

worksite -> site?  khlone.worksite.yml -> khlone.yml? (i.e., worksite is implied by site; just like workzone is implied by  
  zone; just  like workcrew is implied by crew) ? (alternatively, could use repo instead of site...)  

  ---   


  lets go with site for consistency; we can always add aliases in the future; also, zones should be specifiable w/ site       
  scope too. i.e., --zone ahbode/svc-jobs@main vs --zone ahbode/svc-jobs@feat/add-photos-reminder


  ---

now, just like roles are based on rhachet, we also leverage the skills concept embedded within each role from rhachet too.  
  specifically, you can think of skills as macros or pre-declared prompts + executables;                                      
                                                                                                                              
  for example                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                              
  khlone ask --skill review.architecture                                                                                      
                                                                                                                              
  will dispatch a task to ask whichever role knows the skill of review.architecture to invoke it. if the hero knows it, they  
  get it. if theres only one role who knows it, they get it. if there's more than one, failfast and ask for disambig. if      
  there's zero, failfast and inform.                                                                                          
──────────────────────────────────────

---

they're not just prompts; they can be executables too. just say 'role based skills (via rhachet)' instead of                
  'pre-declared- prompts...' 


---

almost forgot 

our crew already specifies the roles that can be weilded

but it doesn't specify the brains

---

some skills dont need brains; that's fine. (e.g., solid skills)

other skills do need brains though; (e.g., fluid and rigid skills)

for those cases, we need to also specify under the crew the different brains that can be used

the first brain will be the hero brain (just like the first role is the hero role)

its the default if a --brain is not prescribed

but we should also be able to prescribe the use of a brain for any act/ask

e.g.,

grok
claude
codex
gemini
etc

expect these to be rhachet brain slug filters; khlone will be able to import 'getAvailableBrains' from 'rhachet' and filter against those to match

and just like the crew yaml specifies aliases for the roles

itll specify aliases for the brains too

e.g.,

grok = xai/grok/code-fast-1
claude = anthropic/claude/code/opus/v4.5
codex = openai/codex/v5.3
etc
