distill the blackbox criteria in .behavior/v2026_02_12.khlone-worksite/2.1.criteria.blackbox.md into a coverage matrix

emit into .behavior/v2026_02_12.khlone-worksite/2.2.criteria.blackbox.matrix.md

---

create a matrix table for each related set of usecases

## process

1. **extract dimensions** — identify the independent variables that vary across usecases
2. **enumerate combinations** — list all dimension value combinations
3. **map outcomes** — for each combination, record the expected outcome from blackbox criteria
4. **flag gaps** — if any combination lacks a specified outcome, call it out
5. **flag decomposition opportunities** — if too many dimensions, suggest narrower behavioral boundaries

## structure

| ind: var 1 | ind: var 2 | ... | dep: var 1 | dep: var 2 | ... |
|-------------------|-------------------|-----|-----------------|-----------------|-----|
| condition A       | condition X       | ... | outcome 1       | outcome 2       | ... |
| condition A       | condition Y       | ... | outcome 1       | outcome 2       | ... |
| condition B       | condition X       | ... | outcome 1       | outcome 2       | ... |

explicitly label the ind(ependent) vs dep(endent) varialbes in the table header, as well

## terminology

- independent variables: the inputs/conditions that vary between subcases
- dependent variables: the expected outcomes for each combination (can be multiple per row)

## why

- visualize all combinations at a glance
- spot gaps via symmetric analysis — if a row is absent, ask why
- verify the blackbox criteria covers all meaningful permutations

## decomposition signal

if there are too many independent variables (matrix explodes) — this signals the usecase is too broad

callout opportunities to decompose into smaller behavioral boundaries when:
- the matrix has 4+ independent dimensions
- combinations exceed what's reasonable to enumerate
- unrelated concerns are bundled together

a narrower scope = a clearer matrix = a more maintainable and recomposable system
