blackbox criteria = experience boundaries (no implementation details)

## episode experience

a sequence of exchanges — the narrative flow

- what workflows do users go through?
- what do they see, do, and receive at each step?
- what are the critical paths through the episode?
- what are the edge cases in the narrative?

## exchange experience

atomic — a single input→output contract

- what inputs does the system accept?
- what outputs does the system return?
- what errors does the system surface?
- what are the boundary conditions?

---

DO NOT include:
- mechanism details (what contracts/components exist)
- implementation details (how things are built)

note: blackbox is NOT "why to build" — that's the wish
      blackbox is "what experience must be delivered" to fulfill the wish
