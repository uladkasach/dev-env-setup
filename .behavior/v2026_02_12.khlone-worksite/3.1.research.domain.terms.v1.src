research the domain available in order to fulfill
- this wish .behavior/v2026_02_12.khlone-worksite/0.wish.md
- this vision .behavior/v2026_02_12.khlone-worksite/1.vision.md (if declared)
- this criteria .behavior/v2026_02_12.khlone-worksite/2.1.criteria.blackbox.md (if declared)

specifically
- what are the terms that we need to coin for the new domain.objects required to fulfill the above?
  - entities
  - events
  - literals
- what are the relationships between the domain objects?
  - is there a treestruct of decoration?
  - is there a treestruct of common subdomains?
  - are there dependencies?
- how do folks commonly talk about these domain.objects?
  - use citations from websearch


ultimatelly,
- propose options for each of the new domain.objects, what should we call them?

our objective is to
- maximize specificity => eliminate ambiguity & minimize confusion
- maximize intuition => eliminate friction & maximize adoption

to create a ubiquitous language

---

use web search to discover and research
- cite every claim
- number each citation
- clone exact quotes from each citation

---

explicitly consider parallel concepts from other domains
- bluecollar
- healthcare
- recreation
- cullinary
etc

the older the domain, the deeper the words
