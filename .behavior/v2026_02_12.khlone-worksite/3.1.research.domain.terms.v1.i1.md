# khlone v0.0: domain terms research

> toward a ubiquitous language for site orchestration

---

## domain objects required

from the vision, these domain objects need terms:

| object | purpose | type |
|--------|---------|------|
| orchestrator | global state across machine | entity |
| site | repo-level container | entity |
| zone | worktree/branch instance | entity |
| clone | enrolled brain (brain bound to role) | entity |
| crew | clones in a zone | literal (collection) |
| task | unit of work | entity |
| skill | role-based capability | literal |
| brain | llm provider/model | literal |

## term analysis by domain object

### 1. orchestrator (global state)

**current term:** orchestrator

**parallel concepts:**
| domain | term | fit |
|--------|------|-----|
| military | command center | high — central coordination |
| construction | headquarters | medium — too corporate |
| theater | production office | low — too theatrical |
| naval | admiralty | low — too hierarchical |
| compute | dispatcher | medium — more about dispatch than state |

**options:**
1. **orchestrator** — conducts all sites like orchestra conductor [20]
2. **command** — military command center terminology [14]
3. **dispatch** — job dispatch center terminology [25]
4. **hub** — neutral, central point

**recommendation:** keep **orchestrator** — it captures the coordination role without direct execution implied. the orchestra metaphor is apt: the orchestrator coordinates sites like a conductor coordinates sections [20].

---

### 2. site (repo-level container)

**current term:** site (was "worksite")

**parallel concepts:**
| domain | term | fit |
|--------|------|-----|
| construction | jobsite, worksite | high — where work happens [4] |
| military | post, base | medium — too military |
| naval | berth | low — too specific |
| compute | project | medium — overloaded |

**options:**
1. **site** — short for worksite, implies location of work [4]
2. **post** — military assignment location [15]
3. **base** — home location, operations base
4. **yard** — construction yard, shipyard

**recommendation:** keep **site** — concise, implies a location where work occurs. "worksite" is redundant since "site" alone conveys the work context [4]. avoids overloaded terms like "project" or "repo".

---

### 3. zone (worktree/branch instance)

**current term:** zone

**parallel concepts:**
| domain | term | fit |
|--------|------|-----|
| construction | zone, area | high — designated work area |
| military | sector | medium — too military |
| kitchen | station | high — specialized work area [9] |
| naval | watch | medium — implies time period [11] |

**options:**
1. **zone** — construction zone, work zone
2. **station** — kitchen station, work station [9]
3. **post** — assigned position [15]
4. **berth** — assigned place (nautical)

**recommendation:** keep **zone** — familiar from construction ("work zone"), implies bounded area with dedicated activity. avoids confusion with "station" which could mean the clone's position rather than the worktree.

---

### 4. clone (enrolled brain)

**current term:** clone

**parallel concepts:**
| domain | term | fit |
|--------|------|-----|
| biology | clone | high — identical copy of template [26] |
| compute | actor, worker | high — unit of computation [22] |
| theater | performer, understudy | medium — too theatrical |
| construction | hand, worker | medium — too generic |
| apiculture | drone, worker | medium — drone has negative connotations |

**options:**
1. **clone** — enrolled brain bound to a role template [26]
2. **actor** — actor model terminology, independent unit [22]
3. **agent** — software agent, autonomous entity
4. **hand** — "deck hand," "ranch hand" — worker
5. **worker** — thread pool terminology [24]

**recommendation:** keep **clone** — it captures the key concept: a clone is an enrolled brain — a brain bound to a role within a zone. multiple clones of the same role are identical in capability but each is a distinct enrollment. the biology metaphor is precise [26]. "actor" is also strong but overloaded in ui contexts.

---

### 5. crew (clones in a zone)

**current term:** crew

**parallel concepts:**
| domain | term | fit |
|--------|------|-----|
| construction | crew | high — team under foreman [1] |
| naval | crew, watch | high — ship's personnel [11] |
| theater | crew, cast | high — backstage team [5] |
| compute | pool | medium — less personified [24] |
| apiculture | colony | medium — implies hive structure [17] |

**options:**
1. **crew** — construction crew, stage crew [1][5]
2. **team** — generic, overloaded
3. **pool** — worker pool [24]
4. **troupe** — theater troupe
5. **squad** — military squad

**recommendation:** keep **crew** — deeply rooted across construction [1], naval [11], and theater [5] domains. implies a cohesive group that works together under direction. "pool" is too mechanical; "team" is overloaded.

---

### 6. task (unit of work)

**current term:** task

**parallel concepts:**
| domain | term | fit |
|--------|------|-----|
| compute | task, job | high — unit of work [25] |
| construction | job, assignment | high — assigned work |
| military | mission, assignment | medium — too military |
| theater | cue | low — too specific |

**options:**
1. **task** — standard compute term [25]
2. **job** — job queue terminology [25]
3. **order** — dispatched instruction
4. **ticket** — issue track
5. **request** — api terminology

**recommendation:** keep **task** — standard, well-understood. "job" could work but conflicts with "job queue" at a higher level. task is atomic and clear.

---

### 7. skill (role-based capability)

**current term:** skill

**parallel concepts:**
| domain | term | fit |
|--------|------|-----|
| construction | trade, specialty | high — specialized capability |
| kitchen | station specialty | medium [9] |
| compute | capability, method | medium — too generic |

**options:**
1. **skill** — learned capability, can be invoked
2. **trade** — specialized craft
3. **specialty** — area of expertise
4. **art** — skilled practice

**recommendation:** keep **skill** — aligns with rhachet terminology. implies that it can be learned, practiced, and invoked. clear and intuitive.

---

### 8. brain (llm provider/model)

**current term:** brain

**parallel concepts:**
| domain | term | fit |
|--------|------|-----|
| biology | brain | high — center of cognition |
| compute | engine, model | medium — too mechanical |
| philosophy | mind | medium — too abstract |

**options:**
1. **brain** — cognitive center, decision-maker
2. **mind** — entity that thinks
3. **engine** — process engine
4. **model** — ml model (too technical)

**recommendation:** keep **brain** — intuitive, personified. a clone has a brain that thinks. clearer than "model" or "engine" for non-technical users.

## relationship structure

```
orchestrator (singleton)
└── site* (one per repo)
    ├── config (khlone.yml)
    │   └── crew
    │       ├── hero (default role + brain)
    │       ├── roles (aliases)
    │       ├── brains (aliases)
    │       └── hooks
    └── zone* (one per worktree)
        ├── crew (collection)
        │   └── clone* (enrolled brains)
        │       ├── role (from crew.roles)
        │       ├── brain (from crew.brains)
        │       └── queue
        │           └── task*
        └── state files (.khlone/.bind/)
```

**treestruct of decoration:**
- clone enrolls brain to role (adds instance state: queue, status, pid)
- task decorates skill (adds execution state: progress, artifacts)

**treestruct of subdomains:**
- dispatch: orchestrator → site → zone → clone → task
- observation: watch, talk, log
- enumeration: list, status

| **zone** | worktree instance; isolated workspace for a branch | construction work zone |
| **crew** | collection of clones in a zone | construction/naval crew [1][11] |
| **clone** | enrolled brain; brain bound to a role within a zone | biological clone [26] |
| **task** | unit of work; ask or act | compute task [25] |
| **skill** | role-based capability; invokable via --skill | learned ability |
| **brain** | llm provider/model; cognitive engine | biology |
| **hero** | default clone for a zone; receives tasks by default | protagonist |
| **enroll** | create new clone instance (role++) | enrollment — brain bound to role |
| **dispatch** | send task to clone | military dispatch [14] |
