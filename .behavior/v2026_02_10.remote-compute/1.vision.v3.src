illustrate the vision for khlone — remote robot clones for development

emit into .behavior/v2026_02_10.remote-compute/1.vision.v3.md

---

khlone = a local/remote coordinator that enables remote robot clones

key concepts:
- one cloud machine per worksite (typically per git worktree)
- local tui handles dispatch, status, attach, conflict resolution
- sync via git patches (batch), not live filesystem mount
- reconnect on dropped connections, queue when offline
- conflict notification + manual resolution (no auto-merge)
- async batch model, not teletype/real-time

paint a picture of what the world looks like when khlone is in use

testdrive the contract we propose via realworld examples

specifically,

## the outcome world

- what does a day-in-the-life look like with khlone?
- what's the before/after contrast?
- what's the "aha" moment where the value clicks?

## user experience

- what usecases do folks fulfill? what goals?
- what khlone commands do they use?
- what timelines do they go through?
- how do they handle conflicts?

## architecture

- what components exist?
- how does the tui communicate with remote clones?
- how does git patch sync work?
- where does state live?

## mental model

- how would users describe khlone to a friend?
- what analogies or metaphors fit?
- what terms would they use vs what terms would we use?

## evaluation

- how well does it solve the goals?
- what are the pros? the cons?
- what edgecases exist and how does khlone keep users in a pit of success?
- cost comparison vs v1 (homelab) and v2 (all-cloud)

## open questions

- orchestrator design
- patch conflict resolution ux
- multi-worktree coordination
- secrets management
- instance lifecycle (when to spin up/down)

uncover awkward tradeoffs
