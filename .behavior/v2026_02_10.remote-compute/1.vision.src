paint a picture of what the world looks like when this wish is fulfilled

testdrive the contract we propose via realworld examples

specifically,

## the outcome world

- what does a day-in-the-life look like with this in place?
- what's the before/after contrast?
- what's the "aha" moment where the value clicks?

## user experience

- what usecases do folks fulfill? what goals?
- what contract inputs & outputs do they leverage?
- what would it look like to leverage them?
- what timelines do they go through?

## mental model

- how would users describe this to a friend?
- what analogies or metaphors fit?
- what terms would they use vs what terms would we use?

## evaluation

- how well does it solve the goals?
- what are the pros? the cons?
- what edgecases exist and how do our contracts keep users in a pit of success?

uncover anything awkward
