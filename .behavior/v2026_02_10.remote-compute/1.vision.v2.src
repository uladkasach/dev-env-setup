illustrate the vision for an all-cloud approach to remote-compute

emit into .behavior/v2026_02_10.remote-compute/1.vision.v2.md

---

pivot from v1 (homelab + cloud hybrid) to v2 (all-cloud, no local hardware)

key assumptions:
- ai agents do most development work (file edits are infrequent for humans)
- local machine only needs to dispatch requests and display results
- compute scales elastically based on task demands
- pay-per-use beats fixed hardware for sporadic or burst usage

paint a picture of what the world looks like when this wish is fulfilled

testdrive the contract we propose via realworld examples

specifically,

## the outcome world

- what does a day-in-the-life look like with this in place?
- what's the before/after contrast?
- what's the "aha" moment where the value clicks?

## user experience

- what usecases do folks fulfill? what goals?
- what contract inputs & outputs do they leverage?
- what would it look like to leverage them?
- what timelines do they go through?

## architecture

- what components exist?
- how do they communicate?
- where does state live?

## mental model

- how would users describe this to a friend?
- what analogies or metaphors fit?
- what terms would they use vs what terms would we use?

## evaluation

- how well does it solve the goals?
- what are the pros? the cons?
- what edgecases exist and how do our contracts keep users in a pit of success?
- cost comparison vs v1 (homelab)

## open questions

- orchestrator design
- agent communication protocol
- secrets management
- repo sync strategy
- when does cloud lose to hardware?
