khlone site & khlone crew -vs- khlone worksite and khlone workcrew ?

khlone zone? (workzone?)

i.e. 


----


how does the .behavior get sent to the worksite? does it get patch synced on khlone init? or do we commit to the worktree before khlone init?

also, use the `git tree set --name feat/weather-emojified` command instead of the git worktree add && cd dance

---

khlone dispatch -> khlone act|ask ; rhachet semantics; ask = readonly, act = readwrite

---

also, `khlone crew add` -> `khlone crew hire` 

khlone crew members get to hang out after boot; they can get halted to stop resource consumption, but since they can get instantly resumed at any time, they're never retired until the job is done; they stay 'oncall'

e.g.,

khlone crew hire
khlone crew halt
