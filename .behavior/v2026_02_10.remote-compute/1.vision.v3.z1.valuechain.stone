lets distill a valuechain that can be progressively iterated against to produce a chain of incremental value from releases

e.g., whats the first thing that instantiates baseline value and fleshes the fundamental concepts? absolute minimum upon which subsequent features can be based on, yet still coveres enough to provide a 10x improvement on the experience of users based on the vision and the wish?


then, whats the next link in the valuechain that can be added? 

and so on

until we reach the full final vision


---

emit into .behavior/v2026_02_10.remote-compute/1.vision.v3.z1.valuechain.v1.i1.md


---

e.g., first, it'd be cool to atleast dispatch the ability to run tests remotely, even if the brain writes the code locally

that should be able to flesh out the concept of git diff stashes

maybe that's not the best first anchor in the value chain though. explore multiple options


---

ideally, first we'd inventory all the distinct kernels of value that we can supply

then identify which ones are dependencies on others

and then we can see which one is the best anchor (most leverage + most yield) to prioritize first
