wish =

my local machine is too slow 

can't handle the what, 10 codium instances that run simultaneously

i've already forsaken ide's infavor of nvim (which is great)

and yet, the machine is still sluggish

i.e., i type in the terminal and my text lands words behind

somethings clearly amiss

probably this machien sucks, maybe? doesn't matter

---

here's what we'd have ideally

the ability to connect to remote-machines which will host a replica of our development environment

ideally
- some in the cloud network
- some on the local network

---

e.g., 

get a beefy headless machine that lives at home and is available for low latency router-only dependency

then access it via ssh and run with minimal latency (what would it be? would it even be noticable?)

and have it abuse its memory and disk and network (i.e., hardwire ether direct into the router even)

so the laptop is just a head on the machine


---

should be able to treat cloud machines the same way

i.e., easily bootup a development environment on an ec2 machine 

clones whatever setup i specify


---

how feasible is this? the local network option is the most important

cloud would be nice when in transit though

alternative question                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                              
  what if we pivot our approach to                                                                                            
  1. we only dispatch requests locally                                                                                        
  2. we only execute requests remotely                                                                                        
                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                              
  and given that we use robots to do all our development these days                                                           
                                                                                                                              
  and the frequency of remote file edits is so low                                                                            
                                                                                                                              
  then we could simply                                                                                                        
  - have a tui that runs locally (super slim) that forwards our requests against the remote agents                            
  - have the remote agents always live on ec2 machines (or eks or whatnot)                                                    
                                                                                                                              
  and avoid the local machines all together?

 lets make it clear that khlone is also a determinstic repl; overlays any other brain repl (e.g., claude code) and writes to it on your        
  behalf; shows you its outputs. does a good job of eliminateion of fluff so that your terminal is low resource consumption   
  and stable                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                              
  easily lets you drop into the remote session on demand, too                                                                 
                                                                                                                              
  and retains the full brain stream , input and output, that it produced so you can review, archive, and reflect on it (you   
  paid fr those tokens, after all)

 it doesn't JUST wrap repls though; its a brain orchestrator, basically. i.e., if your worksite has multiple clones at the  
  same time (codex, 3x claude code, etc) it lets you manage your worksite, talk direct to whichever ones you want (e.g., drop in on the brains repl session), see the crew (which role each brain.repl was enrolled with, what they're up to), and see the worksite (diffs, server.usage, etc)
