specifically
- what are the open source tools that we can leverage to solve this?
- how can we use them? examples?
- are they maintained? are there examples of frontier dev shops who use them?
- which ones should we consider?
- pros and cons of each?

---

focus exclusively on the production codepaths. ignore test codepaths

note, this includes any infra that production codepaths depend on

---

enumerate each pattern
- cite every claim
- number each citation
- clone exact quotes from each citation

---

emit into .behavior/v2026_02_10.remote-compute/3.1.research.patterns._.oss.levers.v1.i1.md
