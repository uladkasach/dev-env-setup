 specifically, i'll probably want to run something like `khlone act 'fulfill this milestone 
  .behavior/v2026_02_10.remote-compute/1.vision.src' --watch`                                                                  
                                                                                                                               
  and then in a separate terminal, open it, and say `khlone ask 'what do you think about x?' --clone researcher++` which      
  would spinup a new researcher and ask them something else                                                                    
                                                                                                                               
  and in a third terminal, open it and say `khlone act 'also, consider xyz. add it to the vision'` which would go to the      
  first clone that handled the first act (the default clone)                                                                   
                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                               
  and all of these would need to understand that as soon as the first khlone act runs, khlone init runs under the hood,       
  binds the branch+worktree via `.khlone/.bind.worksite/zone.yml,crew.yml,task.yml` (local orchestrator persitance), so that  
  the subsequent terminals know exactly the state of the worksite (what zone, what crew, what tasks) (where tasks = asks or   
  acts, enqueued)  


  ===

 yep, and the roles will be specified in khlone.worksite.yml at gitroot already, so khlone will know exactly how to spin     
  one up                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                              
  also, --clone -> who; i.e., --who researcher++ (-vs- who researcher.1)   

we should be able to alias role names too though. e.g., mechanic = ehmpathy/mechanic (since some role names may be          
  repeated across role repos)

❯ another benefit which is not yet claerly articulated is that determinsitic task evaluation                                  
                                                                                                                              
  each task (aact, ask) is deterministically tracked                                                                          
                                                                                                                              
  and when the clone's episode ends for the task, we can hook to ask things like 'provide a summary' and 'was it fully        
  done'?                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                              
  and those outputs can be emitted as detemrinistic artifacts associated with the task                                        
                                                                                                                              
  so that when the human runs `khlone status`, they can see the recently completed tasks and the summary and confirmations    
  (atever else theyv'e cooked onto on task completion)

  also, it should be clear that  you can work with anye, even if its not the zone for your current pwd; e.g., if i open a     
  terminal from no where, i should be able to say `khlone act 'respond to pr feedback' --zone $org/repo@$branch (with         
  org/repo optional if within same rep or just org if within same org o) ; should also be able to spin up a temp --zone that  
  s way tootoo. not even nessesarily temp. to say something like `khlone act 'describe how genContextBrain should be used'    
  --zone ehmpathy/rhachet@main --await >> .refs/howto.rhachet.genContextBrain.md` - and this would tell our command to wait   
  until the clone has completed the action and take their output artifact and pipe it to this file; shell supah native
