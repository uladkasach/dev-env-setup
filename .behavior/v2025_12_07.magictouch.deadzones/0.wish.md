# Wish: Magic Trackpad Dead Zones

Ignore touch input from the top-left and top-right corners of the Apple Magic Trackpad to prevent accidental palm touches during normal use.

## Specification

- Dead zones: left 1/5 and right 1/5 of trackpad width, top 1/2 of trackpad height
- Only reject touches that **start** in these zones
- Touches that start elsewhere and slide into dead zones should continue tracking
