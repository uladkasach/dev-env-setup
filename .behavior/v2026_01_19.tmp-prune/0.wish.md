wish =

we wish to prune the $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR dir for files that our user has created (e.g., jest tests that write to it) that haven't been touched in over 3hrs

we want to research
- why isn't this standard out of the box?
- what are downsides to doing this?

we want to add this to our install_env.sh ; src/install_env.sh
