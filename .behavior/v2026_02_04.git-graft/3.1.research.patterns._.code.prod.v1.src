- how do they relate to the wish?
- which ones will we reuse? which ones will we extend? which ones will we replace?
  - mark with

focus exclusively on the production codepaths. ignore test codepaths

note, this includes any infra that production codepaths depend on

---

enumerate each pattern
- cite every claim
- number each citation
- clone exact quotes from each citation

emit into .behavior/v2026_02_04.git-graft/3.1.research.patterns._.code.prod.v1.i1.md
