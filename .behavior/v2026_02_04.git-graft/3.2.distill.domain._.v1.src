procedure
1. declare the usecases and envision the contract that would be used to fulfill the usecases
2. declare the domain.objects, domain.operations, and access.daos that would fulfill this, via the declastruct pattern in this repo

specifically
- what are the domain objects that are involved with this wish
  - entities
  - events
  - literals
- what are the domain operations
  - getOne
  - getAll
  - setCreate
  - setUpdate
  - setDelete
- what are the relationships between the domain objects?
  - is there a treestruct of decoration?
  - is there a treestruct of common subdomains?
  - are there dependencies?
- how do the domain objects and operations compose to support wish?
